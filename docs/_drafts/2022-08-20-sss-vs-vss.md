Do we need the "verifiable" part in VSS? Can we we build a PoW
Threshold Signature?

We have access to all player's pubkey in the shares and we also know
how much PoW they put in based on the difficulty in their shares, or
know the difficulty in other ways as we have discussed before.

If we use the two things 1) the pubkey as an identifier and 2) the PoW
generated by the pubkey, then do we need to "verify" the shares sent
out by a dealer? I am thinking this is wasteful validation. 

We know a miner generated x EH in last week, which is y% of the pool's
hashrate, by sending shares that are invalid they are throwing money
away. If more 66% of miners are throwing money away, the pool is dead
anyway.

During the DKG and TS part can we replace VSS with a simple SSS and
save some communication complexity.

Another question. Are all players equal? Do we need (t,n) TS or do we
need 66% of "hashrate threshold signature"?

I am coming to these from the thought that PoW is a solve for BFT
agreement, and so is VSS. If we are lucky to have access to PoW, why
not use that to solve out BFT agreement for a TS problem instead of
working as though we don't have access to PoW?
