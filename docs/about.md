I devised a novel DAG based consensus algorithm for mobile ad-hoc
networks in 2004/5 for my PhD from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.

Thanks to Bitcoin there has been a lot of interest in distributed
systems. Along with Bitcoin, tools like TLA+ are making it really fun
to explore distributed systems again.
